# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This code sets up a Tic-Tac-Toe game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The HTML defines the structure, including a game board with 9 boxes, a reset button, and a message container for displaying the game results. 
The CSS styles the game elements, ensuring the game board and the buttons are visually appealing and centered.
The JavaScript handles the game logic, including player turns, checking for winners, and resetting the game. Players click on boxes to place "X" or "O" the game checks for a winner or draw after each move. The reset and new game button allow players to start a new game.
